# php-shopify
PHP-Shopify with Angular file drag-n-drop

This dirty looking script demonstrates how to add a product to Shopify with image upload.

Used php-curl, AngularJS, Shopify API, keyboard, Stackoverflow and mouse.

One PHP file contains an input validator (that comes from JS). I decided not to validate input. Why? Shopify does it for me :)
Second file is html with Angular's template. Quick and dirty :)
Third file is javascript. For image drag-n-drop support, I took W.Huster's script https://codepen.io/whusterj/pen/ijFgA
